# Rain_Man_Game

Rainman is a Qt-based game where the player controls an umbrella to avoid falling raindrops. The game is designed using C++ with the Qt framework, incorporating elements like `QGraphicsScene`, `QGraphicsView`, and custom graphical items for the umbrella and raindrops. The player's score increases each time they successfully avoid a raindrop using the umbrella.
